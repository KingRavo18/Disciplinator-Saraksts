Aggressive Task Management Program

A Task Management/To-do list Program which is made to ensure every task written down will be completed and the user will be rewarded with points for completing. They will be able to connect to their friends’ profile to compare point counts, because competition births success. That’s how humans are after all.
Completing your tasks will earn you points, praise and self-satisfaction. It will be impossible to verify if the user is not lying. Thus, for now, self satisfaction and a fake leaderboard position will be their reward. Thus, if they cheat, they only cheat themselves.
If the user didn’t complete a task in the time frame allotted to them, they will lose points and the task will remain permanently on the screen, ruining their clean streak. To remove it, they will have to complete tasks continuously. If they wish to erase a task after putting it up, they will be hit with a difficult problem (math, language, physics, etc.) and still hit with the penalty. When a penalty is in effect, the background becomes an uncomfortable red. But if they continue to do tasks, they will be able to put the background in any color they want.
Daily Tasks:
There will also be daily tasks set with an automatic expiry date of the next day’s midnight. These tasks will be simply things that better a person’s life.
For each task, the shorter the time frame is after creating the task, the more points the user will get.
Day Planner:
A user will be able to create a day planner for themselves, which they will be able to earn points from by checking off their daily activities.

Other features may be added.
